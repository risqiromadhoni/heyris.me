## Understanding Domain Transfer

Domain transfer refers to the process of moving the ownership of a domain name from one registrar (domain registration service provider) to another. This process involves several steps, including:

1. **Transfer Approval**: The domain owner needs to approve the transfer. This usually involves obtaining an authorization code (auth code) from the old registrar.

2. **Initiating the Transfer**: After obtaining the authorization code, the owner can request the transfer to the new registrar.

3. **Verification Process**: The new registrar will verify to ensure that the legitimate domain owner wants the transfer.

4. **Completing the Transfer**: Once all verification steps are completed, the domain will be moved to the new registrar, and the owner will receive confirmation.

## Why Choose Cloudflare?

When developing a website on a low budget, it is advisable to choose a service that offers many **free** features to publish the website we have created. Here, I choose Cloudflare because its servers are widely distributed around the world, including in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesia. Additionally, Cloudflare provides a comprehensive solution to optimize the speed of our website.

## Transfer from Niagahoster/Hostinger to Cloudflare

### 1. Preparing the Domain
At this stage, make sure you already have a domain at [Niagahoster](https://niagahoster.co.id) or [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.co.id/) that will be transferred to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). When purchasing, we do not need to buy an SSL certificate because SSL will only be used if we buy hosting as well; in this case, we do not need hosting.
> **ðŸ’¡ Tips:** For personal portfolio or blog websites, I recommend buying a domain with the .me extension, as it is cheaper and intended for personal branding websites. [Reference](https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/me-domain#:~:text=me%20domains%20are%20used%20for,to%20personalize%20an%20online%20presence.)

### 2. Changing the Nameserver
1. **List Domain**
![Dashboard Domain List](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-domain-list.png "Niagahoster Domain List")
After purchasing the domain, you will have a list of domains you have bought on the [**Domain Portfolio**](https://hpanel.hostinger.com/domains) page. Select the manage menu on the domain you want to transfer.
2. **Manage Domain**
![Niagahoster Manage Domain](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-manage-domain.png "Niagahoster Manage Domain")
At this stage, you will find the **DNS/Nameserver** menu where you can see the default configuration set up by the Niagahoster team.
3. **Register Domain to Cloudflare**
![Cloudflare Transfer Domain](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare Transfer Domain")
I assume you already have an account at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). Then click the **"Add"** menu on the header as shown in the image above. In the dropdown menu, select **"Existing domain"**.
![Cloudflare Enter Domain to Transfer](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-register-domain.png "Cloudflare Enter Domain to Transfer")
After clicking the **"Existing domain"** menu, you will be directed to a form to register the domain you bought at Niagahoster or Hostinger. Enter the domain name along with its extension (e.g., heyris.me), then check the radio button **"Manually enter DNS records"**.
![Cloudflare Transfer Domain Price](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-price-transfer-domain.png "Cloudflare Transfer Domain Price")
Scroll to the bottom of the price list and select the **"Free"** price package and press continue.
![Dashboard Cloudflare DNS](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-dns-cloudflare.png "Dashboard Cloudflare DNS")
To find the Nameserver (NS), scroll down, and you will find two Nameservers used by Cloudflare. Copy or save these two Nameservers. Then return to the Niagahoster dashboard tab on the **"DNS/Nameserver"** page.
4. **Manage DNS/Nameserver**
![Niagahoster Manage DNS](@/assets/blogs/how-transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/dashboard-manage-dns.png "Niagahoster Manage DNS")
On this page, you will be presented with 2 options: **Use Niagahoster** and **Change nameserver**. Choose Change nameserver and fill in the input for the first and second order with the Nameservers we obtained in the previous step.

### 3. Checking Nameserver Propagation
After completing the above steps, we need to wait at least 24 hours for the Nameserver Domain transfer process to complete. We can continuously check using tools called DNS Checkers, e.g., [**gdnspc**](https://www.gdnspc.com/dns-propagation-checker/id.html) or using the command line as follows in the terminal with the command `ping heyris.me` (in this example using the domain heyris.me, change it according to your domain).
